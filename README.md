This is a unique news headline generator that takes a set of previously chosen headlines and a Markov model to generate new ones.

Problem: RPS is a PR firm (https://www.rockpaperscissors.biz/) that tasked me during an internship program to create a tool that would generate unique headlines to inspire ideas to present to potential clients. In order to create a solution for this, I created a scraper to identifty all headlines ever published under the sponsorship of RPS. I used the headlines to generate unique headliens using Natural Language Processing techniques including a Markov Chain.


A list of the data used to generate headlines can be found in data.txt. (note this is not used in the program, just for viewing purposes)
